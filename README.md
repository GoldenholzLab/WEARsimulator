# WEARsimulator
Simulation for the WEAR collaboration group

## Current code
* wear_group.py - functions for the wear group
* weargroup_v2.py - new improved code (main software is found here)
* realSim.py - the CHOCOLATE simulator
* trialSimulator.py - useful functions for simulation of clinical trials
* wear-paper-v3.ipynb - current version of code for paper-ready figures and analysis

## old code for historical interest</n>
* playground_old.ipynb - old code that is no longer of interest, but also trying a bunch of stuff
* runner_mini.ipynb - useful for running longer code on a second machine
* wear_retired.py- retired outdated code
* wear_paper.ipynb - python notebook with outdated results
* wear_paper-v2.ipynb - pythin notebook with outdated results
* realSim-fake.py - a fake simulator, obviously will run much faster
